[Relational Operators]
=   :A = B		:TRUE if expression A is equal to expression B otherwise FALSE.
==  :A == B 	:A <=> B:Returns same result with EQUAL(=) operator for non-null operands, but returns TRUE if both are NULL, FALSE if one of the them is NULL. (As of version 0.9.0.)
<>  :A <> B		:NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if expression A is NOT equal to expression B, otherwise FALSE.
!=  :A != B		:Synonym for the <> operator.
<   :A < B		:NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if expression A is less than expression B, otherwise FALSE.
<=  :A <= B		:NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if expression A is less than or equal to expression B, otherwise FALSE.
>   :A > B		:NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if expression A is greater than expression B, otherwise FALSE.
>=  :A >= B		:NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if expression A is greater than or equal to expression B, otherwise FALSE.
BETWEEN_AND :A BETWEEN B AND C	    :NULL if A, B or C is NULL, TRUE if A is greater than or equal to B AND A less than or equal to C, otherwise FALSE. This can be inverted by using the NOT keyword. (As of version 0.9.0.)
NOT_BETWEEN_AND :A NOT BETWEEN B AND C	    :NULL if A, B or C is NULL, TRUE if A is greater than or equal to B AND A less than or equal to C, otherwise FALSE. This can be inverted by using the NOT keyword. (As of version 0.9.0.)
IS NULL     :A IS NULL					    :TRUE if expression A evaluates to NULL, otherwise FALSE.
IS NOT NULL :A IS NOT NULL				    :FALSE if expression A evaluates to NULL, otherwise TRUE.
IS          :A IS (TRUE|FALSE)	            :Evaluates to TRUE only if A mets the condition. (since:3.0.0 )
IS NOT      :A IS NOT (TRUE|FALSE)	        :Evaluates to TRUE only if A mets the condition. (since:3.0.0 )
LIKE        :A LIKE B				        :NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if string A matches the SQL simple regular expression B, otherwise FALSE. The comparison is done character by character. The _ character in B matches any character in A (similar to . in posix regular expressions) while the % character in B matches an arbitrary number of characters in A (similar to .* in posix regular expressions). For example, 'foobar' like 'foo' evaluates to FALSE whereas 'foobar' like 'foo_ _ _' evaluates to TRUE and so does 'foobar' like 'foo%'.
NOT LIKE     :A NOT LIKE B				    :NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if string A matches the SQL simple regular expression B, otherwise FALSE. The comparison is done character by character. The _ character in B matches any character in A (similar to . in posix regular expressions) while the % character in B matches an arbitrary number of characters in A (similar to .* in posix regular expressions). For example, 'foobar' like 'foo' evaluates to FALSE whereas 'foobar' like 'foo_ _ _' evaluates to TRUE and so does 'foobar' like 'foo%'.
RLIKE       :A RLIKE B					    :NULL if A or B is NULL, TRUE if any (possibly empty) substring of A matches the Java regular expression B, otherwise FALSE. For example, 'foobar' RLIKE 'foo' evaluates to TRUE and so does 'foobar' RLIKE '^f.*r$'.
REGEXP      :A REGEXP B					    :Same as RLIKE.
[Arithmetic Operators]
+	:A + B	:Gives the result of adding A and B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.

-	:A - B	:Gives the result of subtracting B from A. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.
*	:A * B	:Gives the result of multiplying A and B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands. Note that if the multiplication causing overflow, you will have to cast one of the operators to a type higher in the type hierarchy.
/	:A / B	:Gives the result of dividing A by B. The result is a double type in most cases. When A and B are both integers, the result is a double type except when the hive.compat configuration parameter is set to "0.13" or "latest" in which case the result is a decimal type.
%	:A % B	:Gives the reminder resulting from dividing A by B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.
&	:A & B	:Gives the result of bitwise AND of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.
|	:A | B	:Gives the result of bitwise OR of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.
^	:A ^ B	:Gives the result of bitwise XOR of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the common parent(in the type hierarchy) of the types of the operands.
~	:~A		:Gives the result of bitwise NOT of A. The type of the result is the same as the type of A.
[Logical Operators]

OR 	    :A OR B		:TRUE if either A or B or both are TRUE, FALSE OR NULL is NULL, otherwise FALSE.
NOT A	:NOT ?		:TRUE if A is FALSE or NULL if A is NULL. Otherwise FALSE.
! 		:! ?		:Same as NOT A.

array			:array(val1, val2, ...)							:Creates an array with the given elements.

[Operators on Complex Types]
A[n]	:A[n]	:Returns the nth element in the array A. The first element has index 0. For example, if A is an array comprising of ['foo', 'bar'] then A[0] returns 'foo' and A[1] returns 'bar'.

If start_date is the last day of the month or if the resulting month has fewer days than the day component of start_date, then the result is the last day of the resulting month. Otherwise, the result has the same day component as start_date. The default output format is 'yyyy-MM-dd'.Before Hive 4.0.0, the time part of the date is ignored.As of Hive 4.0.0, add_months supports an optional argument output_date_format, which accepts a String that represents a valid date format for the output. This allows to retain the time format in the output.For example :add_months('2009-08-31', 1) returns '2009-09-30'.add_months('2017-12-31 14:15:16', 2, 'YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') returns '2018-02-28 14:15:16'.

next_day()			:next_day(string start_date, string day_of_week)	:Returns the first date which is later than start_date and named as day_of_week (as of Hive 1.2.0). start_date is a string/date/timestamp. day_of_week is 2 letters, 3 letters or full name of the day of the week (e.g. Mo, tue, FRIDAY). The time part of start_date is ignored. Example: next_day('2015-01-14', 'TU') = 2015-01-20.
trunc()				:trunc(?, string format)	:Returns date truncated to the unit specified by the format (as of Hive 1.2.0). Supported formats: MONTH/MON/MM, YEAR/YYYY/YY. Example: trunc('2015-03-17', 'MM') = 2015-03-01.
months_between()	:months_between(date1, date2)	:Returns number of months between dates date1 and date2 (as of Hive 1.2.0). If date1 is later than date2, then the result is positive. If date1 is earlier than date2, then the result is negative. If date1 and date2 are either the same days of the month or both last days of months, then the result is always an integer. Otherwise the UDF calculates the fractional portion of the result based on a 31-day month and considers the difference in time components date1 and date2. date1 and date2 type can be date, timestamp or string in the format 'yyyy-MM-dd' or 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'. The result is rounded to 8 decimal places. Example: months_between('1997-02-28 10:30:00', '1996-10-30') = 3.94959677
date_format()		:date_format(?, string fmt)	:Converts a date/timestamp/string to a value of string in the format specified by the date format fmt (as of Hive 1.2.0). Supported formats are Java DateTimeFormatter formats – https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html. The second argument fmt should be constant. Example: date_format('2015-04-08', 'y') = '2015'.date_format can be used to implement other UDFs, e.g.:dayname(date) is date_format(date, 'EEEE')dayofyear(date) is date_format(date, 'D').Prior to Hive 4.0.0 (HIVE-25458), it uses [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html] and hence the supported patterns have changed.
